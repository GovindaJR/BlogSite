# Blog Site
Blog Site with notifications using Observer Pattern. Users can create blogs posts on the website and view blog posts written by other users. The project is meant to provide users a space to talk about their own interests and share them with other people. It can be a creative outlet, or a place to share knowledge one thinks others should know. A user can receive email updates whenever a new blog is posted onto the website by providing their email address on the site. 

The application is written using the ASP.NET framework written in C# and uses the Model-View-Controller pattern to separate business logic from the display.
